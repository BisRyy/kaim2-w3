# Alpha care Insure Analytics
Task 1:
Git and GitHub

    Tasks: 
        Create a git repository for the week with a good Readme
        Git version control 
        CI/CD with Github Actions
    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
        Dev Environment Setup.
        Relevant skill in the area demonstrated.

Project Planning - EDA & Stats

    Tasks: 
        Data Understanding
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        Statistical thinking
    KPIs:
        Proactivity to self-learn - sharing references.
        EDA techniques to understand data and discover insights,
        Demonstrating Stats understanding by using suitable statistical distributions and plots to provide evidence for actionable insights gained from EDA.

Minimum Essential To Do

    Create a github repository that you will be using to host all the code for this week.
    Create at least one new branch called ”task-1” for your analysis of day 1
    Commit your work at least three times a day with a descriptive commit message
    Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) analysis on the following:
        Data Summarization:
            Descriptive Statistics: Calculate the variability for numerical features such as TotalPremium, TotalClaim, etc.
            Data Structure: Review the dtype of each column to confirm if categorical variables, dates, etc. are properly formatted.
        Data Quality Assessment:
            Check for missing values.
        Univariate Analysis:
            Distribution of Variables: Plot histograms for numerical columns and bar charts for categorical columns to understand distributions..
        Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis:
            Correlations and Associations: Explore relationships between the monthly changes TotalPremium and TotalClaims as a function of ZipCode, using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
        Data Comparison
            Trends Over Geography: Compare the change in insurance cover type, premium, auto make, etc. 
        Outlier Detection:
            Use box plots to detect outliers in numerical data
        Visualization
            Produce 3 creative and beautiful plots that capture the key insight you gained from your EDA
